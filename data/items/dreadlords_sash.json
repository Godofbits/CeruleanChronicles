Dreadlords, those who have mastered the darkest necromantic arts, wear such sashes as symbols of their terrible power. The sash enhances the wearer's ability to command undead and makes their death magic nearly irresistible. Those who don this sash feel the pull of the grave, hearing the whispers of the restless dead.",
