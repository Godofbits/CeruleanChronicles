  "description" : "A scroll covered in mesmerizing swirling patterns that seem to move on their own. This spell creates a twisting pattern of colors that entrances those who gaze upon it, leaving them swaying mindlessly. The technique was first used by yuan-ti priests to pacify sacrificial victims, but wizards quickly realized its tactical value. A well-placed hypnotic pattern can end a battle without a single death. Single use.",
