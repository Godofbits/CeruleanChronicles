  "description" : "A scroll that seems to weigh nothing in your hand. This transmutation lifts the target straight up into the air, allowing them to float at a height they can control. Unlike true flight, levitation provides only vertical movement—the caster must push off walls or pull themselves along ropes for horizontal travel. The spell was invented by a dwarf who was tired of being unable to reach high shelves. It remains popular for accessing high places and avoiding floor-based traps. Single use.",
