  "description" : "A belt designed to resemble a serpent coiled around the waist. The metal scales move smoothly against each other, and the belt seems almost alive. It grants the wearer the fluid flexibility of a snake, making them harder to grapple or restrain. Thieves and escape artists prize such belts for obvious reasons.",
