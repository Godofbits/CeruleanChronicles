  "description" : "A tan scroll bearing the image of an invisible barrier. This reaction spell conjures a shield of magical force just in time to deflect an incoming blow or spell. The barrier appears as a shimmer in the air, deflecting arrows, swords, and even magic missiles. It was invented during the War of the Magi by a quick-thinking abjurer who realized that timing mattered as much as power. Many wizards have survived deadly encounters thanks to this split-second defense. Single use.",
