  "description" : "A small red scroll warm to the touch. This cantrip hurls a mote of fire at a target, one of the most straightforward combat spells available. The flame burns hot enough to ignite flammable objects and deals respectable damage for a cantrip. Evokers can cast this spell endlessly, making it their go-to attack when conserving more powerful magic. The simple elegance of turning magical energy directly into flame has made this cantrip a staple across cultures. Single use.",
