  "description" : "A black scroll bearing a skull and crackling with necrotic energy. This spell is among the most feared in necromancy's arsenal, sending a ray of death that can instantly kill weaker creatures and gravely wound even mighty heroes. The magic was developed by the lich-king Larloch, who sought to recreate the touch of death itself. Those slain by this spell rise as zombies under the caster's control. The spell's verbal component is a single word in the language of death, and speaking it is said to age the caster. Single use.",
