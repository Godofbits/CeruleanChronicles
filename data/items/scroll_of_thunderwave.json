  "description" : "A tightly rolled scroll that rumbles with barely contained thunder. This spell unleashes a wave of thunderous force that throws back enemies and shatters glass. Storm giants first taught this magic to mortal wizards as a gift, showing them how to channel the voice of thunder itself. The boom can be heard for miles, making stealth impossible but announcing the caster's power unmistakably. Single use.",
