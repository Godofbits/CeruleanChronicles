The metal is black as coal but burns with hellfire, and the air around it shimmers with heat. Devils crafted this belt for a mortal warlord who sold his soul for power. The wearer becomes a conduit for hellfire, their spells blazing with increased intensity while flames dance around them, scorching nearby foes.",
