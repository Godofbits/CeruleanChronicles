The magic concentrates nature's bounty, making survival in the wilderness far easier. Druids and rangers rely on goodberries when traveling through barren lands or sustaining injured companions. A single casting can feed an entire party for a day. The berries taste of sunshine and summer, no matter the season. Single use.",
