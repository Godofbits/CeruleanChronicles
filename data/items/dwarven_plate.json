  "description" : "Masterwork plate forged in dwarven forges deep beneath mountains. Dwarven smiths are unmatched in their craft, creating armor lighter and stronger than human-made plate. The armor is covered in runic inscriptions that strengthen the metal and ward against breakage. Owning dwarven plate is a mark of prestige, as the dwarves rarely sell their finest work to outsiders.",
