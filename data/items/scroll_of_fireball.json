  "description" : "A crimson scroll radiating heat, inscribed with runes that glow like embers. Fireball is perhaps the most iconic destructive spell in existence, conjuring a bead of flame that explodes in a massive inferno. The spell was perfected by fire elementalists studying volcanic eruptions, capturing that catastrophic power in arcane formula. A single fireball can end a battle or destroy a building. Evokers dream of casting their first fireball, for it represents a pinnacle of destructive magic. Single use.",
