  "description" : "A purple scroll inscribed with diagrams of folded space. This lesser teleportation opens a brief portal through the fabric of reality, allowing instantaneous travel across shorter distances. Unlike true teleportation, Dimension Door sidesteps the dangers of long-distance travel, making it the preferred escape spell of thieves and assassins. The spell was invented by a halfling illusionist trying to reach a high shelf. Single use.",
