  "description" : "A black scroll that feels cold and hungry to the touch. This spell allows the caster to drain life force with a touch, healing their own wounds with stolen vitality. The magic mimics vampiric feeding, channeling the target's life energy directly to the caster. Necromancers developed this spell by studying true vampires, creating a temporary version of their most terrifying ability. The sensation of draining life is said to be intoxicating and addictive. Many a dark wizard has fallen to evil after tasting this power. Single use.",
