  "description" : "Red and gold plate forged from metals that fell from the sky. According to legend, a phoenix sacrificed itself in a volcano's heart, and from its ashes this armor was forged. The plate grants resistance to fire damage and provides advantage on death saving throws. If the wearer drops to 0 hit points, flames engulf them once per week, healing 4d8 hit points. Like the phoenix, the wearer rises from ashes reborn.",
